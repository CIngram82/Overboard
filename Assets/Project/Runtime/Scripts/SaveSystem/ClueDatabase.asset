  - _name: Skeleton Key
    _id: 0
    _note: The Captain wanted me to guard the boiler room from tresspassers. There
      is 1 skeleton key which should open a safe. Inside is an important tool. The
      key is split into 3 parts in room A65, A60, and in my room.
  - _name: Unlock the Boiler Room
    _id: 0
    _note: It must be locked. Maybe a key will open it?
  - _name: 'Get the Gear box Running '
    _id: 0
    _note: It doesn't seem to be working. Maybe with power I can get them to turn
      and put them in the right order to get this dumbwaiter working.
  - _name: Get the Pipes in Working Order
    _id: 0
    _note: The connection between the pipes seems to be broken. Maybe if I rotate
      some of them then I can get it flowing again. I think it goes from left to
      right.
  - _name: 'Power the Dumbwaiter '
    _id: 0
    _note: It needs to powered somehow. I should try to get to the boiler room and
      turn the steam power on. If I can get the power running maybe I can use this
      to get out of here.
  - _name: 'Heading home '
    _id: 0
    _note: 'Dec 12, 1918

      I''m finaly heading home now that the great war has
      ended. I''ve have been given passage on the HMS <Ship Name> in exchange for
      working in the boilder room. '
  - _name: On the open sea
    _id: 0
    _note: "Dec 15, 1918\r\nCaptain J. Brown wanted me to guard the boiler room from
      trespassers. He is a bit more unhinged than I originally thought. The Key is
      locked in a safe in my room. But I can\u2019t open the safe on my own. I have
      the handle to the safe key, but 3 others have the teeth for the strange key.
      \r\n"
  - _name: Crewmates
    _id: 0
    _note: "~Ethan Herman (A65\r)\nA well-organized man, a bit obsessed with everything
      running on time. He is always checking that pocket watch and never lets anyone
      hold it. \r\n~Mr. Winston (A63)\r\nI don\u2019t mind a cigar from time-to-time,
      but I have never seen Mr. Winston with one. He is constantly flicking that
      lighter but is unwilling to use it to light a cigar for me. \r\n~Miss Patricia
      Piccadilly (A60)\r\nThe ships bookkeeper, she has amazing penmanship and loves
      the pen the Captain gave her when she started. From time to time, I see her
      looking at it longingly.  \r\n"
