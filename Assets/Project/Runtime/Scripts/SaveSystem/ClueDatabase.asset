  _items:
  - _name: Open the Safe
    _id: 0
    _note: Theres a safe in here. Inside should be something I need to use to escape.
      Where where those skeleton key pieces stashed?
  - _name: Unlock the Boiler Room
    _id: 0
    _note: It must be locked. Maybe a key will open it?
  - _name: 'Get the Gear box Running '
    _id: 0
    _note: It doesn't seem to be working. Maybe with power I can get them to turn
      and put them in the right order to get this dumbwaiter working.
  - _name: Get the Pipes in Working Order
    _id: 0
    _note: The connection between the pipes seems to be broken. Maybe if I rotate
      some of them then I can get it flowing again. I think it goes from left to
      right.
  - _name: 'Power the Dumbwaiter '
    _id: 0
    _note: It needs to powered somehow. I should try to get to the boiler room and
      turn the steam power on. If I can get the power running maybe I can use this
      to get out of here.
