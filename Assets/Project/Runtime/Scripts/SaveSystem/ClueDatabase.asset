  - _name: 'Get the Gear box Running '
    _id: 0
    _note: It doesn't seem to be working. Maybe with power I can get them to turn
      and put them in the right order to get this dumbwaiter working.
  - _name: Get the Pipes in Working Order
    _id: 0
    _note: The connection between the pipes seems to be broken. Maybe if I rotate
      some of them then I can get it flowing again. I think it goes from left to
      right.
  - _name: 'Power the Dumbwaiter '
    _id: 0
    _note: It needs to powered somehow. I should try to get to the boiler room and
      turn the steam power on. If I can get the power running maybe I can use this
      to get out of here.
  - _name: 'Heading home '
    _id: 0
    _note: 'Dec 12, 1918

      I''m finally heading home now that the great war
      has ended. I''ve have been given passage on the HMS Selina in exchange for
      working in the boiler room.

  - _name: On the open sea
    _id: 0
    _note: "Dec 15, 1918\r\nCaptain J. Brown wanted me to guard the boiler room from
      trespassers. He is a bit more unhinged than I originally thought. The Key is
      locked in a safe in my room. But I can\u2019t open the safe on my own. I have
      the handle to the safe key, but 3 others have the teeth for the strange key.

    _note: "~Ethan Herman (A6\r3)\nA well-organized man, a bit obsessed with everything
      running on time. He is always checking that pocket watch and never lets anyone
      hold it. \r\n~Mr. Winston (A60)\r\nI don\u2019t mind a cigar from time-to-time,
      but I have never seen Mr. Winston with one. He is constantly flicking that
      lighter but is unwilling to use it to light a cigar for me. \r\n~Miss Patricia
      Piccadilly (A65)\r\nThe ships bookkeeper, she has amazing penmanship and loves
      the pen the Captain gave her when she started. From time to time, I see her
      looking at it longingly.  \r\n"
  - _name: I need to get off the ship!
    _id: 0
    _note: 'The ship has hit something and is filling with water. I need to get to
      the top deck fast. It looks like everyone else is gone I hope there is still
      a lifeboat. Ever sinse the Titanic a few years ago ships have more lifeboats
      than they need.  '
  - _name: Stairs Blocked!
    _id: 0
    _note: Dear lord the stairs are blocked I have got to find another way to the
      top deck. Maybe I can fit in the dumbwaiter?
  - _name: The key
    _id: 0
    _note: 'Once I have all 3 of the key teeth, I can assemble this. The teeth parts
      are so small they could be lost if not kept safe. '
