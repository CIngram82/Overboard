  _items:
  - _name: 'Get the Gear Box Running '
    _id: 0
    _note: The Gear Box doesn't seem to be working. Maybe with power I can get the
      gears to turn and put them in the right order to get this Dumbwaiter working.
  - _name: Get the Pipes in Working Order
    _id: 0
    _note: The connection between the pipes seems to be broken. Maybe if I rotate
      some of them then I can get it flowing again. I think it goes from left to
      right.
  - _name: 'Power the Dumbwaiter '
    _id: 0
    _note: It needs to be powered somehow. I should try to get to the <color=#ff0000><b>Boiler
      Room</b></color> and turn the steam power on. If I can get the power running
      maybe I can use this to get out of here.
  - _name: 'Heading Home '
    _id: 0
    _note: 'Dec 12, 1918

      I''m finally heading home now that the great war
      has ended. I have been given passage on the HMS Selina in exchange for working
      in the Boiler Room.'
  - _name: On the Open Sea
    _id: 0
    _note: "Dec 15, 1918\r\nCaptain J. Brown wanted me to guard the Boiler Room against
      trespassers. He is a bit more unhinged than I originally thought. The Key is
      locked in a <color=#ff0000><b>Safe</b></color> in my room. But I can\u2019t
      open the safe on my own. I have the handle to the safe key, but 3 others have
      the teeth for the strange key."
  - _name: Crewmates
    _id: 0
    _note: "~Ethan Herman (A65)\r\nA well-organized man, a bit obsessed with everything
      running on time. He is always checking that\n<color=#ff0000><b>Pocket Watch</b></color>
      and never lets anyone hold it.\r\n<size=5> </size>\r\n~Mr. Winston (A63)\r\nI
      don\u2019t mind a cigar from time-to-time, but I have never seen Mr. Winston
      with one. He is constantly flicking that <color=#ff0000><b>Lighter</b></color>
      but is unwilling to use it to light a cigar for me. \r\n<size=5> </size>\r\n~Miss
      Patricia Piccadilly (A60)\r\nThe ship's bookkeeper, she has amazing penmanship
      and loves the <color=#ff0000><b>Pen</b></color> the Captain gave her when she
      started. From time to time, I see her looking at it longingly."
  - _name: I Need to Get Off the Ship!
    _id: 0
    _note: The ship has hit something and is filling with water. I need to get to
      the top deck fast. It looks like everyone else is gone I hope there is still
      a lifeboat. Ever since the Titanic a few years ago ships have more lifeboats
      than they need.
  - _name: Stairs Blocked!
    _id: 0
    _note: Dear lord, the stairs are blocked! I have got to find another way to the
      top deck. Maybe I can fit in the <color=#ff0000><b>Dumbwaiter</b></color>?
  - _name: The Key
    _id: 0
    _note: "Once I have all <color=#ff0000><b>3</b></color> of the key teeth, I can
      assemble this key. The key teeth are small and could be hidden easily on one\u2019s
      person."
