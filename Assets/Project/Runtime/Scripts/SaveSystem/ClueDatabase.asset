  - _name: Locked Safe
    _id: 0
    _note: Theres a safe in here. I think I overheard another passenger talking about
      3 people having parts of a key to open it. I have to find those pieces.
  - _name: Locked Door
    _id: 0
    _note: 'It must be locked. I don''t think any key is going to be in there anyway. '
  - _name: Gears
    _id: 0
    _note: 3 gears seem to be mising. I don't think it will start without them. They
      must be somewhere around here.
  - _name: Pipes
    _id: 0
    _note: The connection between the pipes seems to be broken. Maybe if I rotate
      some of them then I can get it flowing again. I think it goes from left to
      right.
  - _name: Dumbwaiter
    _id: 0
    _note: It needs to powered somehow. I wonder if theres a boiler room around here?
