#### 2.1 Commit Messages
<a name="2.1.1"></a>
**2.1.2** Commit Messages must be descriptive. This allows other developers to have an idea of what was changed and why it was changed without having to look at a diff of the commit.


<a name = "commits-org"></a>
#### 2.2 Commit Practices
<a name="2.2.1"></a>
**2.2.1** Commits should ***NEVER*** be committed to the main branch directly. This bypasses code review processes that help keep the codebase as sanitary as possible

#### 3.2 Branch Naming Conventions

<a name="3.2.1"></a>
**3.2.1** Branch names should start with the Jira task associated with them. This lets developers get any and all relevant information pertaining the nature of the task, such as notes, technical documentation, or acceptance criteria.
> If there isn't a task associated with the work, there should be.

**3.2.2** In the off-chance that there isn't a Jira task associated with the branch at hand, use `[NoJira]` in the branch name to designate it as such
